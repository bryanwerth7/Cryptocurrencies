# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
This project was designed to analyze current Cryptocurrencies by using unsupervised machine learning. My analysis took into account all tradable Cryptocurrency coins, counted their total coins mined and the total supply of them. I used the K-means algorithm and found that the best fit for my analysis was 4 clusters. The 4 clusters were then classified based on proof type, algorithm, and the net difference between how much of the coin has been mined and the total supply. This analysis can be used further to see which coins might be a good investment, based on that net difference of coins in supply vs coins mined. The best way to make money in the crypto market is to get in while the coins are plentiful and cheap, and be able to predict which coins will appreciate in value. Happy Crypto hunting!!
